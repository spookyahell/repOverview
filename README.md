# spookyahell's repository-overview
A repo with details about my repos (including forks)

## Repos related to online services
### Streaming video platforms (VOD)
#### YouTube and like a ton more
[youtube-dl](https://github.com/spookyahell/youtube-dl) - _Last modified: 2021-04-30_
<br>Nearly unchanged fork of youtube-dl (only 2 "minor" commits which only affect README.md)
<br>Only still exists due to a [dmca-counter notice filed to GitHub](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2021/04/2021-04-13-RIAA-counternotice.md), which subsequentally notified the RIAA
<br>Again, RIAA, _this_ is a prominent location. Your claim of _prominent_ just wasn't. Deal with it. 😎

_Check out below fun projects too!_
